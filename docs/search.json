To enter a command, click on the “Execute Query” button. Pressing the Enter key will not execute the query.\nSQL is not case sensitive. It is common to see SQL commands written in uppercase, and we will do so below, but lowercase is also accepted. Cases matter only when referring to variables, tables, and other database objects. Variable names must be quoted with single quotes. Table names are not quoted.\nSQL commands can be written over multiple lines. For human readability, it is common to write different components of a command on separate lines, as you will see in the following examples.\nYou can enter any of these queries in the Enter Query box on the data portal. Substitute table_name with the name of the table you want to query. Substitute variable1, variable2, etc. with the names of the variables you want to query. Substitute condition with the condition you want to apply.\n\nGet all data from a table\nSELECT * FROM table_name\n\n\nGet specific columns from a table\nSELECT variable1, variable2 FROM table_name\n\n\nGet specific rows from a table\nSELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition\n\n\nGet specific rows and columns from a table\nSELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name \nWHERE condition\n\n\nExample of conditions\nWHERE ticker = 'AAPL' and date &gt;= '2024-01-01'\n\n\nGet only the first rows from a table\nThis is useful to get an understanding of a table structure.\nSELECT * FROM table_name LIMIT 10\n\n\nGet the number of rows in a table\nSELECT COUNT(*) FROM table_name\n\n\nJoin tables\nWe will often want to get an industry classification from the Tickers table to combine with variables selected from another table. This is called a join operation. Other join operations are also useful. The Tickers table contains several industry and sector classifications (industry, sector, sicindustry, sicsector, famaindustry, siccode). The “as” in the following example can be omitted.\nSELECT A.ticker, A.industry, B.date, B.close\nFROM tickers as A inner join sep as B on A.ticker = B.ticker\nWHERE B.date = (SELECT MAX(date) FROM B)\n\n\nClose and open variables in sep table\nThe sep table contains daily closing prices and adjusted closing prices (close and adjclose). It also contains the open price (open).33"
